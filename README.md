<h3>Auth Component</h3> <br>
Contains the form (uses two way binding) that allows me to login and add/delete/edit of projects/skills <br>
It uses  the auth service which send my credentials to firebase then redirects me to home page <br>
After login buttons for adding/editing/deleting projects/skills appear  <br>
I used an AuthGuard to protect the child comonents that allow me to add skills/projects<br>
